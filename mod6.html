    <h1>Decision making in python (CONTINUED WITH ELIF)</h1>
    <p>
      Elif is a unique extra option in decision making of python. The elif command can continue from an if command, but unlike the else command which can continue from the if command, it doesn't make the block of code end there. This allows a set of true or false statements to be tested all at the same time. If just one of them is true, it runs the following code, and then ends there. For example if multiple keys go to the same door, and each key has a different value, the door can use elif to test each key, and if one of them works, the door will open.
