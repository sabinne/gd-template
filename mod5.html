    <h1>Decision making in python</h1>
    <p>
      Decision making in pyhton allows circumstances withing code to be accessed if a specific condition is true. For example in a text based game, the players location in one place, could change the condition of another place, so that the player can access new places beyond that. There is also the unique option to have multiple true false statements in one true false statement. Decision making is very important, because it allows parts of code to change based on a "true, or false" question. This makes extra complexity to code available, and gives opportunity to the code to creatively make paths. If the condition is false, and there is no else statement, then the code will continue uninterupted.
