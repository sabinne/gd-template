    <h1>Enumerations in Python</h1>
    <p>
      Enumerations, or enum, is a way in python to make a name represent a value that has no humanly comprehensible meaning. It can assign a set of values to a set of names, and therefor it is useful in organizing things in python. Multiple things can be put into organzized classifications of classifications, a bit like having folders, and folders withing those folders. When a value makes absolutely no sense in a block of code, enums can give the coder and speculators a better understanding of what the code means.
