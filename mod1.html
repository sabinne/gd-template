    <h1>Printing in Python</h1>
    <p>
      I have no experience with python, but soon I will be using it to create a text based game.
      I haven't used it before, but I know it is useful for making text based games.
      I am exited to start making games. Once I understand how to use python, I can expand my creativity to make interesting stories in python.
