    <h1>Variables in python continued</h1>
    <p>
      Variables are able to be assigned to other variables, and multiple variables can be assigned to multiple variables. For example lets say that there are animals in a game, and each animal either attacks the character, or remains passive, the variable "evil" makes the animal attack the character. Instead of assigning evil to each monster individually, it can be done simply in a list of variables all tied to the same assignment "evil". This is one of the many ways the unique potential sytax's of variables can be used for faster productivity/complexity.
