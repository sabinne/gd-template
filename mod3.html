    <h1>Basic syntax in Python</h1>
    <p>
      I am learning about variables, and how to use variables in unique ways. Variables in python allow a large amount of user customization. For example commands can be assigned to a user created variable, so that the user can create a complex command within a script and use it multiple times. They can also save the command, and place it on a file for use in future projects by copying and pasting it to other scripts. Variables are very important in python because they allow access to manifestation of scripts, and they increase the brisk pace of coding within python.
      <a href='code/variables.py' target='_blank' >variables.py</a> . My practice script is here.
