    <h1>Transition, and definition navigation in Python</h1>
    <p>
      I am going to try to execute a very small script in order to practice the basics of a text based game in python. I am using definitions and transitions between the definitions in order to create a player navigatable space. Once the script runs with all functions working properly, I will have succeeded. The basic functions I am practicing, is the creation of definitions (which in the game would be places) represented by the definitions name followed by an equals sign followed by the places description. Transitions define possible ways to navigate between these places. The script I will make will be a large boat, and the character will be trapped in a small section of it due to a door being blocked by rubble. 
      <a href='code/boat.py' target='_blank' >Here</a> is my practice script.
