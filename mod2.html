    <h1>Basic syntax in Python</h1>
    <p>
      I am learning the basic sytax, and punctuation methods in python. To practice my skills, I am going to create a script incorporating multiple aspects of the syntax, and puntuation rules of python. The commands in python are very user friendly, because many of them are words that directly relate to the action they perform. Following the tradition of easy utilization in python, puntuation is also quite simple. To end a piece of the script for examplpe, all that is required is an empty line. Knowing the syntax, and punctuation in python will cause less frequent mistakes/errors, and the ability to code at a faster speed, with less breaks to review the rules of pyhton.
