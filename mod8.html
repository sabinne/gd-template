    <h1>Lists in Python</h1>
    <p>
      Lists useful for categorizing values in python. They can help the user by allowing them to create a memorizable list with many values that they can access quickly. For example, if consecutive letters are damage values for melee weapons in a python game. The creator can site different values from that list to assign specific damage amounts to a weapon. Lists are made by writing the name of the list, a space, an equals sign, a space, followed by the values of the list inside of apostrophe's separated by comma's followed by a space, within square brackets, and ended with a semi colen. Here is what it looks like: listExampleName = ['listValue1', 'listValue2', 'etcederaValueEtcedera'];  . There is a video example down below of the syntax of lists, and an example of how they can be used.
